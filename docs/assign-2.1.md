(The idea inherits some part of my work in unit 1. Please take a look here: [assignment link](./docs/assign-1.2.pdf))

### Introduction (topic):
In this game, your avatar is a kid with limited vocabularies. One day, your parents tell you to buy some items from a certain vendor on the street. Now, your job is to understand where to find the specified vendor and buy correct items back to home.

Please take a glance at this clip from Japanese TV Show. This might give you an idea the situations kids might face when they go shopping with limited language skills.

### Who is your audience?
My target audience is aimed at 15 yr+ or adults. They have basic English knowledge and want to extend their vocabularies. More specifically, these vocabularies they might want to memorize:

 - cantankerous
 - peevish
 - macabre
 - gruesome

It's easy to memorize any one of them. But these vocabularies appear rarely in their daily speech, and sometimes hard to realize their meaning on a dictionary with limited vocabularies.

### How to apply content (vocabularies) to the game?

Consider this example:

`Task: buy apples from a cantankerous host`

During this task, you roam on the the street and communicate with NPC. Each NPC might have different dispositions, expressions and looking. However, the one you should buy apples from is the "cantankerous" one. So, once you meet a bad-tempered NPC and have a hard conversation with him/her, you have to buy apples from this NPC.

### What is the fun in your topic/game?

It's fun to explore on the street. And to stimulate the players' experience, these characters usually act in exaggerated expressions. And the task itself might be funny as well. For instance, in this game you might be told to purchase items from a narcissistic person. But in real life nobody will ask you to do something in this way!

### Where/how do you propose the game will be played?

On Smartphone, PC or anywhere accessible to the internet. The goal is to keep game itself simple and fun. So I decide to develop this game on cross-platform or web-based.

As I surveyed, building this game on Facebook might be a good starting point with 2D engine -- Cocos2d. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/cocos2d-x

How do you think someone would use your game to teach?

 - High school teacher: distributing this game in a English class. Some tasks are designed to be very hard and need students to cooperate together to solve it.
 - Self learner: this game's mainly goal is to make people keep growing their vocabularies without losing their passions. If the game is designed interesting enough, it's possible for people to memorize these hard vocabularies in this game.
