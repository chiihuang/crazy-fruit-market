## Description
>Make sure the subject matter, target learners, and target environment are clear.

#### Subject matter
Facilitate ESL learners' learning process for learning advanced English vocabularies.

For example, the advanced vocabularies could be `nonchalant`, `restive`, `mendacious`, etc.

Although it's easy to memorize any one of them with rote learning, these vocabularies rarely appear in daily speech and hence they are difficult to realize and memorize their meaning.

#### Target audience
The target audience is aimed at 15 yr+ or adults. They have basic English knowledge and want to extend their vocabularies. 

#### Target environment
On Smartphone, PC or anywhere accessible to the internet. The goal is to keep game itself simple and fun. Therefore, at current stage, I do not take 3D graphics into consideration. I decide to develop this game on cocos2d because it is a cross-platform game engine.


## Why Crazy Fruit Market?

>Make sure your instructional goals are clear, and explain why you believe your game is an appropriate fit for them.

This game aims at using **game experience** to help players realize the words with contexts, plots, or conversation, but not just giving them the definition found in the dictionary.

In most of cases, the target learners tend to learn and memorize those advanced vocabularies by using rote learning or flashcards, because these methods have been believed as the fastest ways for a long time. However, purely memorizing their definitions is not the same thing as *realizing* them. For example, when encountering the advanced word in an article, these learners sometimes have to speak out its definition to help realizing what the word stands for in the context.

On the contrary, in this game, players can learn those words from the conversation with the apples representing the words. This helps players connecting vocabularies to these conversation. They will be able to recall the words from these memories directly, without interpretating the words from their formal definitions again. In this case, this kind of learning is much closer to **realizing** a word and therefore an appropriate fit for the target learners.

### Development
> What was hard? What was easy?

I felt these 3 parts are the most challenging during the process of development:

1. Engineering
The game engine I choose is cocos2d-js, an open source cross-platform 2D game framework. Because the framework, especially v3.x, is still under heavy development by community, most documentation is premature and some bugs appear unexpectedly. In these cases, I had to dig into their source code to know how an API works and how to tweak the code to make the game work.

2. Game art design
In this project, I use GIMP to design most of the UI elements such as buttons, panels, icons, etc. Compared to Photoshop, GIMP has much lesser tutorials, materials and resources. Therefore things become challenging, especially as a beginner of art designer.

3. Integration
Chaining the tools from graphic design (GIMP), game scene design (Cocos Studio) to software engineering (Cocos2d-JS) is an arduous task, especially when the resources generated by Cocos Studio are incompatible to the version of Cocos2d-JS I hold. However, if choose not to use one of the tools, the development will become much slower and time-consuming.

4. Material design
For example, I stuck for a long while when I tried to design a conversation for a `jocular` apple. I have little idea how to say a joke in English, let alone putting one in a such limited context. In the future, the context design will be more and more challenging once this game growing bigger.

### Game
> What is satisfying about your final game, and what is frustrating?

#### Satisfying part

After I improved the overall graphic design, the game becomes much more interesting. Many feedbacks from play testers show that they think the game is cute and funny. I think this is good sign and pretty cheering to me.

#### Frustrating part

Many issues are not addressed yet, and some of them might need a huge change on the current design. To afford these huge changes, as a independant game developer, I have to not only speed up the development process, but also try not to make wrong decisions as possible as I could.
