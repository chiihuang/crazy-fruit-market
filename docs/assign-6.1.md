### Description
>Make sure the subject matter, target learners, and target environment are clear.

#### Subject matter
Facilitate the learning process for advanced English vocabularies.

For example, the advanced vocabularies could be `nonchalant`, `restive`, `mendacious`, etc.

Although it's easy to memorize any one of them with rote learning, these vocabularies rarely appear in daily speech and hence they are difficult to realize and memorize their meaning.

#### Target audience
The target audience is aimed at 15 yr+ or adults. They have basic English knowledge and want to extend their vocabularies. 

#### Target environment
On Smartphone, PC or anywhere accessible to the internet. The goal is to keep game itself simple and fun. Therefore, at current stage, I do not take 3D graphics into consideration. I decide to develop this game on cocos2d because it is a cross-platform game engine.

>Make sure your instructional goals are clear, and explain why you believe your game is an appropriate fit for them.

>Perhaps make a video demonstrating how your game works and what elements/features you think are most important (Or, you can explain the elements/features in text.).

>Reflect on your process. What was hard? What was easy? What is satisfying about your final game, and what is frustrating? What parts of the course were the most helpful? Why? Did you find certain course materials to be especially useful? If so, tell us about it. What about peer feedback? How did your experiences in the 11.127x learning community help shape your project? Do you have additional insights from your playtesting sessions? Basically, help us better understand your gameâ€™s journey and what you are thinking about and feeling as the course comes to a close.
