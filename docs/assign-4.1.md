##Crazy Fruit Market - Playtest and Iterate

### Experience of playtest

> A written reflection on your experiences testing your game

I was a little late for letting my friends and more people to test my game. Hopefully, I still got some very useful feedback from them.

#### Unexpected things

> Did things turn out differently than you expected?

##### 1. Missing game functions

The most impressive unexpected thing is *missing game instruction*. Originally, I tried to make the game more intuitive by designing several buttons and icons. However, it turns out many users do not know how they work and how they help me through the game.

##### 2. Feedback quality and quantity

In the beginning, I thought using Google Form to collect feedback would be an excellent way to collect massive feedback. However, although my game was played 100+ times, there are only 4 people leave comments in my form.

#### Pros and cons of feedback types

To summarize pros and cons for feedbacks I tried:

###### A. Post on Facebook

**Pros**

- Players are able to leave comments directly under the post
- Short comments

**Cons**

- After a day, the impressions of the post greatly decrease and so does the number of feedback.
- Players tend not to leave harsh comments, especially when they are known to you
- The comments tend to be short

###### B. Surveys on Google Forms

**Pros**

- High qualiy feedback might appear, if somebody is willing to take the survey seriously.
- People are willing to leave harsh comments anonymously.

**Cons**

- People tend not to take a survey form. Therefore there are very few outcomes.

###### C. Directly watch people playing the game

**Pros**

- The observation is able to reveal several drawbacks hidden inside the game.
- High quality outcomes from players if asking them questions at the same time.

**Cons**

- Chance is scarce, especially for non-digital prototype.

> Would you test your game the same way in the future?

Yes, but not limited to these methods I've tried. I will put more effort to get the chances of watching people playing directly, because those feedback has much better quality and imminent.

### Overview of iterations

> An overview of how you iterated your game based on feedback and observations

As they pointed out, without telling players why they are wrong, my game could become another **spelling bee** tragedy.

In the beginning, I got some feedbacks on the forum and from course intructors and TAs. Thanks to their advices, I found players cannot get enough feedback to know why they are wrong and how to get the correct answers. So I implemented the following features:

1. Dictionary - In easy mode, a player can lookup the dictionary if they are new to the given vocabulary.
2. 3 difficulties - There are 3 different difficulties - easy, normal and hard. In easy mode, a player could lookup the dictionary. In normal mode, the player is supposed to know the vocabularies, so the dictionary is taken away. In hard mode, the player is supposed to deeply understand all the vocabuleries, so the faces of the apples are hidden.
3. Reveal the name of apple in the checkout counter - To tell the player why the answer is wrong, I started with the this basic function -- reveal the name of the apple directly.

After I implemented these features as well as other improvement on the graphics, I shared my game on Facebook with my friends. This time, I got several feedback:

1. Cannot choose questions
All the questions are chosen in random. Some players want the game to provide the questions they haven't fully understanded yet.

2. Cannot tell the difference between easy and normal modes
Most of the palyers did not notice the dictionary icon.

3. Cannot fully understand the vocabularies
Even if they mastered the game, them still don't know how to use those words in their writings. Some even told me they only memorized the apples' faces, but not their definitions.

4. Unknown bugs
The bugs only reported by a few users. This may come from different browsers.

Before I started to address these issues one by one, in the Unhangout event, I discussed the known issues with the participants and they provided some great points as follow:

1. Game instructions
Withough game instrcutions, many players may fail to figure out the functions of the game, even the game core concept.

2. Why it's wrong
Not just telling them the answers for each choice, the game has to tell the **reason** why it's wrong. Although in the previous change the game is able to show the hidden word of a picked apple, this seems not enough.

3. Don't forget failure fun
The current design fails to achieve this. But this should be taken good care of.

After I gathered these useful suggestions, I have more clearer idea how to improve the game. After some changes, I would do more play tests from other friends haven't played them yet.

### Testers

> A brief explanation and list of the type of testers (no names please!) you engaged with

##### 1. Course members

I shared the game and recieved many useful feedback from the course forum, Hangout and Unhangout. The course members are very important game testers because they could provide many insightful feedback after receiving the course.

##### 2. College friends on facebook

Most of my college friends are my target audience. Many of them are able to speak English fluently, but they are usually frustrated when they encounter some articles filled with many hard vocabularies.

>After I released my major change, I shared my game and used google forms to collect feedback. Although most of them did not leave any comment after playing, I still got some very usefull feedback as mentioned.

##### 3. Colleague

I chose my colleague as game tester because I could watch him play besides him. His playing inspired me a lot because I found many problems I failed to deal with.


### Questions for testing

> The questions you used for testing and a few comments on why you picked certain questions

Google Form Link: https://goo.gl/forms/SJC2N0RpiM

There are 5 main topics of the questions.

- Game purpose - an indicator of whether the goal of the game is reached or not
- Game experience / Sharing - an indicator of the fun of the game
- Balance / Difficulty - an indicator of whether the levels are well balanced
- Learning - an indicator of whether the game facilitate the learning process
- Improvement / Feedback - suggestions from game testers

I think none of them is ignorable. They all give me useful information how I should improve the game.
