 > Develop an assessment plan for one or more of the learning objectives for your game. How might you help learners and mentors/teachers understand accomplishments in the game? How can you give the right just-in-time feedback to learners or their guides? In order to answer that question, really consider what your game is asking people to do, and whether you could say anything about their learning based on how they engage with the game. Explain to the course staff and students (in any format you wish) how you will help learners and teachers understand accomplishments/progress in the game.
