## Assessment Plan

> Develop an assessment plan for one or more of the learning objectives for your game.

Because this game is aimed at advanced vocabulary learning, it is more than likely that the learners are individual learners. So in this document, I'll focus more on what kinds of the measurement the game will provide.

This game has 2 major learning objectives -- *comprehension* and *memorization*.

> How might you help learners and mentors/teachers understand accomplishments in the game?

### Comprehension

About this, the comprehension of a word can be measured by counting how many tries does a player use to find out the correct mapping of the context to the given vocabulary.

If a player takes only 1 try to figure it out, this indicates that the player `understands` the vocabulary. If not, it shows that the player `forgets` or `doesn't understand` the vocabulary.

### Memorization

This game should provide both general and specific statistics to show the learning curve of the words a player learns.

#### General statistics

It could be a timeline showing that, for each day, how many vocabularies are `understanded` and how many are `not understanded`.

#### Specific statistics

The game can provide one profile for each of the vocabularies, and each vocabulary profile should includes these metrics:

1. What's the last time a player answers it correctly
2. What's the longest interval a player keeps answer it correctly
3. When does the game suggest to test the gamer the vocabulary again

### Real-time feedback
> How can you give the right just-in-time feedback to learners or their guides?

When a player picks a context for a vocabulary, a just-in-time feedback during the game could include why the chosen context does not match the vocabulary and instead what kind of the context should match the vocabulary.

For example, given a vocabulary `happy`, if the context chosen by a player is an unhappy conversation, a feedback will include:

- The chosen context contains such unhappy elements and therefore the words fitting this context well might be `unhappy`, `sad`, `unsatisfying`.
- But for `happy`, a player should find the context that is showing pleasure, contentment or satisfaction.

> In order to answer that question, really consider what your game is asking people to do, and whether you could say anything about their learning based on how they engage with the game.

> Explain to the course staff and students (in any format you wish) how you will help learners and teachers understand accomplishments/progress in the game.
