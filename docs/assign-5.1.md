## Assessment Plan

> Develop an assessment plan for one or more of the learning objectives for your game.

Because this game is aimed at advanced vocabulary learning, it is more than likely that the learners are individual learners. So in this document, I'll focus more on what kinds of the measurement the game will provide.

This game has 2 major learning objectives -- *comprehension* and *memorization*.

> How might you help learners and mentors/teachers understand accomplishments in the game?

### Comprehension

About this, the comprehension of a word can be measured by counting how many tries does a player use to find out the correct mapping of the context to the given vocabulary.

If a player takes only 1 try to figure it out, this indicates that the player understands the vocabulary.

### Memorization



> How can you give the right just-in-time feedback to learners or their guides?

> In order to answer that question, really consider what your game is asking people to do, and whether you could say anything about their learning based on how they engage with the game.

> Explain to the course staff and students (in any format you wish) how you will help learners and teachers understand accomplishments/progress in the game.
