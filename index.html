        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This project aims at facilitating the learning process of ESL learners for advanced English vocabularies.</p>

        <p>For example, the advanced vocabularies could be <em>nonchalant</em>, <em>restive</em>, <em>mendacious</em>, etc.</p>

        <p>Although it's easy to memorize any one of them with rote learning, these vocabularies rarely appear in daily speech and hence they are difficult to realize and memorize.</p>

        <h3>Target audience</h3>

        <p>The target audience is aimed at 15 yr+ or adults. They have basic English knowledge and want to extend their vocabularies.</p>

        <h3>Target environment</h3>

        <p>On Smartphone, PC or anywhere accessible to the internet. The goal is to keep game itself simple and fun. Therefore, at current stage, I do not take 3D graphics into consideration. I decide to develop this game on cocos2d because it is a cross-platform game engine.</p>

        <h2>Why Crazy Fruit Market?</h2>

        <p>This game aims at using <strong>game experience</strong> to help players realize the words with contexts, plots, or conversation, but not just giving them the definition in the dictionary.</p>

        <p>In most cases, the target learners tend to learn and memorize those advanced vocabularies by using rote learning or flashcards, because these methods have been believed as the fastest ways for a long time. However, purely memorizing their definitions is not the same thing as <em>realizing</em> them. For example, when encountering an advanced word in an article, these learners sometimes have to speak out its definition to help realizing what the word stands for in the context.</p>

        <p>On the contrary, in this game, players can learn those words from the conversation with the apples representing the words. This helps players connecting vocabularies to these conversation. They will be able to recall the words from these memories directly, without interpretating the words from their formal definitions again. In this case, this kind of learning is much closer to <strong>realizing</strong> a word and therefore an appropriate fit for the target learners.</p>
